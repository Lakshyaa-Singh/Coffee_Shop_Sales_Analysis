## Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data from a coffee shop to extract actionable insights. The analysis was conducted using Excel, and a dynamic dashboard was designed to display key performance indicators (KPIs), category-wise distribution, location-wise footfall, and various visualizations using charts and maps.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of raw data from over 150,000 transactions recorded at a coffee shop. This data includes details about sales, transaction times, product categories, and locations.
